This section provides a brief overview of these two influential families of generative models.</p> <div class="l-page"> <center> <img src="/ai819-blogpost/assets/img/2025-04-28-20245589/0_generative-overview.png" alt="Generative Models Overview" style="max-width: 65%; height: auto; object-fit: contain;"> <br> <i>Source: <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lilianweng</a></i> </center> </div> <h2 id="diffusion-models">Diffusion Models</h2> <p>At a high level, diffusion models learn to reverse a process that gradually corrupts data by adding noise. They model the inverse of a <strong>forward diffusion process</strong>, which transforms real data into pure Gaussian noise over time. During training, the model learns this <strong>reverse denoising process</strong>, enabling it to generate realistic samples from noise during inference.</p> <p>Well-known diffusion models include <strong>Stable Diffusion v1.5</strong>, <strong>v2</strong>, <strong>SDXL</strong>, <strong>DALLE-2</strong>, and <strong>Imagen</strong>—all widely used for high-quality text-to-image generation.</p> <p>There are two main types of diffusion models, primarily differing in how they formulate and simulate the diffusion process:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Discrete-time Diffusion Models (DDPMs)</strong><d-cite key="ho2020denoising"></d-cite>: These models define a Markovian noise process in discrete steps. They are typically trained using variational inference, as popularized by the <strong>Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</strong> (DDPM) framework.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Continuous-time Diffusion Models (Score-based SDEs)</strong><d-cite key="song2020score"></d-cite>: These models describe the diffusion process using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), treating diffusion as a continuous transformation governed by differential equations. Sampling involves numerically solving a reverse-time SDE.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Although these approaches differ in formulation—discrete and variational vs. continuous and differential—they aim to model the same data distribution and can be seen as complementary perspectives on generative modeling.</p> <p>In this section, we focus on <strong>score-based SDE models</strong>, examining their mechanisms and effectiveness in generative tasks.</p> <h3 id="core-concept-score-based-sdes">Core Concept: Score-Based SDEs</h3> <p>Score-based generative models define a continuous-time diffusion process using <strong>stochastic differential equations (SDEs)</strong><d-cite key="song2020score"></d-cite>. The key idea is to learn the <strong>score function</strong>—the gradient of the log-probability density—of the data distribution as it evolves over time under the forward diffusion process.</p> <div class="l-page"> <center> <img src="/ai819-blogpost/assets/img/2025-04-28-20245589/0_score-sde.webp" alt="Score-Based SDE" style="max-width: 65%; height: auto; object-fit: contain;"> <br> <i>Source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13456" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">score-SDE</a></i> </center> </div> <h3 id="forward-sde">Forward SDE</h3> <p>The forward diffusion process is governed by an SDE of the form:</p> \[d\mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{f}(t, \mathbf{x}_t)dt + g(t)d\mathbf{w}_t,\] <p>where:</p> <ul> <li>$\mathbf{x}_t$ is the state at time $t \in [0, T]$,</li> <li>$\mathbf{f}(t, \mathbf{x}_t)$ is the drift coefficient,</li> <li>$g(t)$ is the diffusion coefficient,</li> <li>$\mathbf{w}_t$ is a standard Wiener process (Brownian motion).</li> </ul> <p>This process gradually corrupts the data $\mathbf{x}_0$ into a noise-like state $\mathbf{x}_T$. Common parameterizations include:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>VE-SDE</strong>: $\mathbf{f}(t, \mathbf{x}_t) = 0$, $g(t) = \sqrt{\beta(t)}$</li> <li> <strong>VP-SDE</strong>: $\mathbf{f}(t, \mathbf{x}_t) = -\frac{1}{2} \beta(t) \mathbf{x}_t$, $g(t) = \sqrt{\beta(t)}$</li> </ul> <p>These formulations ensure that the prior distribution $p_T(\mathbf{x}_T)$ becomes a Gaussian distribution, which contains no information about the original data distribution $p_0(\mathbf{x}_0)$.</p> <h3 id="reverse-time-sde">Reverse-Time SDE</h3> <p>To generate data samples, we solve the <strong>reverse-time SDE</strong><d-cite key="anderson1982reverse"></d-cite>:</p> \[d\mathbf{x}_t = \left[\mathbf{f}(t, \mathbf{x}_t) - g(t)^2 \nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t} \log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\right] dt + g(t) d\bar{\mathbf{w}}_t,\] <p>where $d\bar{\mathbf{w}}_t$ denotes reverse-time Brownian motion and $p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)$ is the marginal density at time $t$.</p> <p>Sampling proceeds by starting from $\mathbf{x}_T \sim p_T(\mathbf{x}_T)$ (typically Gaussian) and solving the reverse SDE numerically—e.g., via the Euler-Maruyama method—from $t = T$ to $t = 0$. The result is a sample $\mathbf{x}_0 \sim p_0(\mathbf{x}_0)$ drawn from the learned data distribution.</p> <h3 id="denoising-score-matching">Denoising Score Matching</h3> <p>The core challenge in solving the reverse-time SDE is estimating the score function $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t} \log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)$—the gradient of the log-probability at time $t$.</p> <p>This is done by training a neural network score estimator $s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t)$ to approximate this score, using <strong>denoising score matching</strong><d-cite key="vincent2011connection"></d-cite>. The loss function is:</p> \[\mathcal{L}_{DSM}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t} \left[ \lambda(t) \, \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x}_0} \left\| s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t) - \nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t} \log p(\mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x}_0)\right\|_2^2 \right]\] <p>Here:</p> <ul> <li>$t$ is sampled uniformly from $[0, T]$,</li> <li>$\mathbf{x}_0$ is drawn from the data distribution,</li> <li>$\mathbf{x}_t$ is a noisy version of $\mathbf{x}_0$, obtained via the forward SDE,</li> <li>The conditional distribution $p(\mathbf{x}_{t} \mid \mathbf{x}_0)$ often admits a closed-form expression under common SDE formulations.</li> </ul> <p>This objective guides the network to match the score function at each time step, enabling accurate sampling from the reverse process.</p> <h2 id="flow-matching-models">Flow Matching Models</h2> <p>In parallel with the development of diffusion models, a new class of generative models known as <strong>flow matching models</strong> has emerged. These models aim to directly learn the velocity vector field of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that maps between two arbitrary probability distributions. Unlike diffusion models, flow matching does not require iterative denoising or sampling from stochastic differential equations. Instead, it leverages principles from optimal transport and continuous normalizing flows, enabling more efficient generation while maintaining high sample quality.</p> <p>Flow matching has gained significant attention due to its use in notable applications such as <strong>Stable Diffusion 3</strong> and <strong>FLUX</strong>, which apply these techniques to improve scalability, controllability, and performance. As a result, flow matching is increasingly seen as a promising alternative to diffusion models in the development of next-generation foundation models.</p> <h3 id="core-concept-flow-matching">Core Concept: Flow Matching</h3> <p>In flow matching, a <strong>flow</strong> $\psi_t(\mathbf{x}_0)$ is defined as the trajectory of a point $\mathbf{x}_t$ in space as it evolves over time $t \in [0, 1]$, starting from an initial point $\mathbf{x}_0$. This process transports samples from a simple prior distribution (e.g., standard normal) to a target distribution (e.g., real data). The flow is governed by an ODE characterized by a <strong>velocity field</strong> $\mathbf{u}_t(\mathbf{x}_t)$, which describes how points move through space over time:</p> \[\frac{d}{dt}\psi_t(\mathbf{x}_0) = \mathbf{u}_t(\psi_t(\mathbf{x}_0))\] <p>To generate new samples from the target distribution, one solves the ODE from $t = 0$ to $t = 1$ using the learned velocity field. This can be done using standard numerical ODE solvers like Euler or Runge-Kutta integration.</p> <p>Unlike diffusion models, which rely on <strong>stochastic SDEs</strong> and denoising score estimation, flow matching models use <strong>deterministic ODEs</strong> with training objectives that directly match the flow of probability mass between distributions.</p> <h3 id="conditional-flow-matching">Conditional Flow Matching</h3> <div class="l-page"> <center> <img src="/ai819-blogpost/assets/img/2025-04-28-20245589/0_conditional_flow_matching.png" alt="Path design in Flow Matching" style="max-width: 65%; height: auto; object-fit: contain;"> <br> <i>Source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06264" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flow Matching Guide and Code</a></i> </center> </div> <p>The flow defines a <strong>probability path</strong> \(p_t(\mathbf{x}_t)\) that evolves continuously from the data distribution $p_1$ to the prior distribution $p_0$. By defining a <strong>conditional probability path</strong> $p_{t \mid 1}(\mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x}_1)$ that conditions on a sample $\mathbf{x}_1$ from the target distribution, the (marginal) probability path path can be written as:</p> \[p_t(\mathbf{x}_t) = \int p_{t \mid 1}(\mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x}_1) p(\mathbf{x}_1) \, d\mathbf{x}_1\] <p>Training a velocity field that exactly matches the marginal path is intractable due to the integral over the data distribution. Instead, one can train using a <strong>conditional vector field</strong> \(\mathbf{u}_t(\mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x}_1)\), which is a tractable target for the velocity field estimator $\mathbf{u}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t)$. The <strong>conditional flow matching (CFM)</strong> loss is:</p> \[\mathcal{L}_{\text{CFM}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t, \mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_t \sim p_{t \mid 1}(\cdot \mid \mathbf{x}_1)} \left\| \mathbf{u}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t) - \mathbf{u}_t(\mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x}_1) \right\|_2^2\] <p>It has been shown that the gradient of this conditional loss is equivalent to that of the marginal flow matching loss<d-cite key="lipman2022flow"></d-cite>, making it a valid and efficient training objective. This is analogous to denoising score matching (DSM) in diffusion models, where the score function \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t} \log p(\mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x}_0)\) is used to train the marginal score estimator $s_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t)$.</p> <h3 id="rectified-flow">Rectified Flow</h3> <p>In <strong>Rectified Flow</strong><d-cite key="liu2022flow"></d-cite>, the conditional probability path $p_{t \mid 1}$ is defined in closed form for a Gaussian prior $p_0 = \mathcal{N}(0, I)$,</p> \[p_{t \mid 1}(\mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x}_1) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t; t\mathbf{x}_1, (1 - t)^2 I)\] <p>which is the simple linear interpolation between the data sample $\mathbf{x}_1$ and a noise sample \(\boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim p_0\) at time $t$.</p> <p>This corresponds to a linear interpolation with Gaussian noise, forming a simple and tractable setup. Under this formulation, the conditional velocity field becomes:</p> \[\mathbf{u}_t(\mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x}_1) = \frac{\mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}_t}{1 - t}\] <p>Thus, sampling from $p_{t \mid 1}$ is straightforward: given a data sample $\mathbf{x}_1$, sample a time $t \sim \mathcal{U}[0, 1]$, then generate:</p> \[\mathbf{x}_t = t\mathbf{x}_1 + (1 - t) \boldsymbol{\epsilon}, \quad \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)\] <p>The corresponding training loss, known as the <strong>Rectified Flow loss</strong>, simplifies to:</p> \[\mathcal{L}_{\text{RF}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}_1, \boldsymbol{\epsilon}, t} \left[ \left\| \mathbf{u}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t, t) - (\mathbf{x}_1 - \boldsymbol{\epsilon}) \right\|^2 \right]\] <p>This loss allows the model to learn how to map noise samples toward the data manifold by following a simple rectified flow field. Because of its simplicity and empirical effectiveness, rectified flow has become a foundational component in modern flow matching-based generative models.</p> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>Modern generative models are dominated by two key approaches: diffusion models, which generate data by reversing a noise process via stochastic differential equations, and flow matching models, which use deterministic ordinary differential equations to transport samples from noise to data. While diffusion models are known for their sample quality, they require slow iterative denoising; flow models like Rectified Flow offer faster generation by learning direct mappings using efficient training objectives. Despite their differences, both methods represent powerful, complementary strategies for modeling complex data distributions and continue to drive progress in generative AI.</p> <hr> <h1 id="non-euclidean-flow-matching">Non-Euclidean Flow Matching</h1> <p>Flow matching, like most deep learning methods, is traditionally formulated in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. However, many real-world data domains—such as molecular structures, protein folding, robotics, and climate systems—reside on non-Euclidean spaces with intricate geometric properties. To properly model such data, flow matching must be extended to curved spaces, leading to the framework of <strong>Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM)</strong>.</p> <h3 id="geometry-from-euclidean-to-riemannian">Geometry: From Euclidean to Riemannian</h3> <p>A <strong>Riemannian manifold</strong> $(\mathcal{M}, g)$ is a smooth space where each point has an associated tangent space and an inner product defined by a <strong>Riemannian metric</strong> $g$.
